            <p> A branding re-fresh of the social not-for-profit organisation ‘For Change Co.’ For Change Co. is a Victorian-based organisation that shares the vision of “an Australia free from youth homelessness.”
                <br>
                <br>
                This refresh sought to reflect the organisation’s strong values, improve the efficacy of their design’s communication and become more visually engaging.
                <br>
                <br>
                The simpler and more contemporary design approach separates the branding from a chain, creating a more personal brand identity. For this branding it is desirable that it feels like another Melbourne cafe, to be a more comfortable introductory working environment for the youth suffering from insecure housing. The goal is to not shine a light on this marginalised youth group; chain-like branding has the potential to highlight this, whereas this typographic-led approach to design creates a sense that it is another cafe in Melbourne.
