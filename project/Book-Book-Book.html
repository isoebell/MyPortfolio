            <p> A book in a book in a book. This project consists of a book which documents a poster containing the first issue of the journal of the Situationist International 
                (published June 1958). The typographic approach of the poster was inspired by <a href="<https://alltheworldsapage.myshopify.com/>">All the World's a Page</a>, 
                with a collaged image of all the leftover packets of birth-control pills, from painkillers post a surgery, and my parking fines. A personal and political 
                commentary of all those institutions that continually take your money. This poster was pasted up in Brunswick, and continued to be documented over time, 
                this documentation, and a copy of the poster, are bound in this book. The cover of which is another iteration of typesetting the journal, this time without the collaged media overlayed. 
                Hence, this project is quite the inception, of a book in a book in a book, and so on.
