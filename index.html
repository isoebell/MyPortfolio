It is created to be observed and visually experienced, however it does not serve as a vessel for information learning. However, that is how it may present, a ‘how to guide’ of sorts. ChatGPT was used to produce the information on best practice and benefits of the morning stretch practice; a satire on artificial intelligence giving us ‘advice’ on how we should be moving our body, presented from the perspective of its own lived experience. </p>

            <p>{2} A branding re-fresh of the social not-for-profit organisation ‘For Change Co.’ For Change Co. is a Victorian-based organisation that shares the vision of “an Australia free from youth homelessness.”
                <br>
                <br>
                This refresh sought to reflect the organisation’s strong values, improve the efficacy of their design’s communication and become more visually engaging.
                <br>
                <br>
                The simpler and more contemporary design approach separates the branding from a chain, creating a more personal brand identity. For this branding it is desirable that it feels like another Melbourne cafe, to be a more comfortable introductory working environment for the youth suffering from insecure housing. The goal is to not shine a light on this marginalised youth group; chain-like branding has the potential to highlight this, whereas this typographic-led approach to design creates a sense that it is another cafe in Melbourne.

This project consists of a book which documents a poster containing the first issue of the journal of the Situationist International (published June 1958). The typographic approach of the poster was inspired by <a href="https://alltheworldsapage.myshopify.com/">All the World's a Page</a>, with a collaged image of all the leftover packets of birth-control pills, and from painkillers post a surgery, and my parking fines. A personal and political commentary of sorts of all those institutions that continually take your money. This poster I pasted up in Brunswick, and continued to document it over time, this documentation, and a copy of the poster, are bound in this book. The cover of which is the typesetting of the journal without the collaged media overlayed.</p>
